I don't really remember what each exercise was about, but try my best to describe them:
* `Lab1` and `Lab2` were simple C# Windows Forms apps
* `Lab3` was about Microsoft SQL Server and connection to application
* `Lab4` was about JavaScript and jQuery
* `Lab5` and `Lab6` were about ASP .NET
* `Exam` consists of few apps that were done during exam at the end of the course. There were four tasks, one for each topic above.
